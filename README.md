Overview

This application is a C++17 program that demonstrates three core data structures:
1. Hash Table for managing movie ticket bookings
2. Linked List for emergency hospital patient management (by severity)
3. Binary Search Tree for real estate property listings

Each part shows how these data structures can be used for real-world tasks like collision handling, priority management, and data organization.
